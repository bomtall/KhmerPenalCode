# Project_Overview

This project is an attempt to create a standardised process for determining sentences for Cambodian crimes, starting with Theft but growing further to cover the entire Cambodian penal code.

The goal is to reduce differences in sentences between judges to ensure there is a single, unified process to follow when determining sentences. 

Developed as part of the ICT Project Management module at London South Bank University for tutors Francis Babayemi and Lucia Otoyo for customer Lionel Blackman.
